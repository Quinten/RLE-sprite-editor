# RLE sprite editor

Editor and converter for Run Length Encoded sprites.

Make tiny pixel art sprites in a text format for game jams where you have a limited file or byte size like [js1024](https://js1024.fun/) or [js13k](https://js13kgames.com/)â€‹.

Inspired by [an article from Andrew Berry](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/having-fun-with-run-length-encoded-sprites-662d6a8147c8) in which he explains how RLE sprites work.
